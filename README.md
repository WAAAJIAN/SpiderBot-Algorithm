This repository contains ROS2 humble package for our DIY Gwen Spider Hexapod Robot. 

The package is still being developed and more details will be uploaded soon. 

Cheers !

Goal of Summer 2025:
Mechanical: Redesign the legs and feet, to ensure firm grip of the ground for smooth movements (add more if needed)
Electrical: Redesign the power system, and implement the IMU to ensure balance of GWEN
Software: Ensure GWEN can move on a straight line (add more if needed)
