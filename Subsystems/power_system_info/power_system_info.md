The current Power System of GWEN is currently under research

Components that are used inside GWEN so far:
x24 MG996R Servomotors
x1 RPI 4 B+
x1 Maestro Servocontroller
x1 MPU6050
(add other electrical elements that you guys will be adding)

Assumption/s for calculations:
- servomotors will not all be used at the same time, and therefore, will calculate half of the servomotors as the worst case scenario
- operation of GWEN will only last at most 20 minutes

Power consumption for each components (will do later)
